# Privacy Policy for Markdown Printer

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025

## Overview

Markdown Printer ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles user data.

## Data Collection

**The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.**

All operations are performed locally in your web browser. No personal information, browsing history, or saved files are sent to any external servers.

## How the Extension Works

1. **Page Content Access**: When you click "Save as Markdown," the Extension accesses the current page's content solely for the purpose of converting it to Markdown format.

2. **Local Processing**: All HTML-to-Markdown conversion happens locally in your browser using the Turndown.js library.

3. **File Saving**: The converted Markdown file is saved to your computer using Chrome's built-in downloads functionality. The Extension does not retain copies of your files.

## Permissions Used

The Extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the current page content for conversion when you use the extension
- **downloads**: To save the converted Markdown file to your computer
- **scripting**: To inject the conversion library into web pages
- **contextMenus**: To provide a right-click menu option

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.
